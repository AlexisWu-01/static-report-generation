class TransferData:
    """
    Class used for transfering data to and from the Air Partners Dropbox account.

    NOTES: The strings currently used in this file are for a test Dropbox made with a test email.
    Air Partners must make its own Dropbox account with its own email, and this setup will have to 
    be reproduced. The link below explains how to get the refresh token after an app has been 
    configured.

    Make sure that all these strings, after being created, are either locally stored on the virtual
    machine or are in a text document/JSON file and not in the Python files themselves. No need to risk
    putting this information on a public Github repository.
