File to create singular files when needed. 
To run from command line, activate virtual environment, then run:

        $ python3 figure.py <YEAR> <MONTH> <FIGURE_TYPE> <SENSOR_ID> <PM>

Where <YEAR> and <MONTH> are replaced with the appropriate year and month from
when the data is from, <FIGURE_TYPE> is replaced with the name of the function
that creates the figure you want to create, <SENSOR_ID> is replaced with the
sensor where the data is from, and <PM> is replaced with the PM you want to analyze.

This dictionary should be used for identifying which PM to use:
- PM 1: 'pm1'
- PM 2.5: 'pm25'
- PM 10: 'pm10'

If you choose to make a timeplot, which includes the plots for all three PMs, set <PM>
to None.
